# Project Description: React Progress Step

## Introduction

This project aims to create a progress step component that guides users through a series of steps to help them create a new project in React. The progress step will display information about the current step, and users will have the ability to navigate through the steps using "Next" and "Prev" buttons. Importantly, this project will be developed using only HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## Project Features

The React Progress Step project will include the following features:

1. **Step Display:** The user will be presented with a clear indication of which step they are currently in.

2. **Next Button:** Initially, users will start with a "Next" button. Clicking it will advance them to the next step.

3. **Step Transition:** When the "Next" button is clicked, a progress bar will slowly load up to indicate the transition to the next step.

4. **Prompt:** Each step will include a displayed prompt or set of instructions.

5. **Prev and Next Buttons:** After reaching the next step, the "Next" button will be replaced with "Prev" and "Next" buttons. Users can go back to the previous step using the "Prev" button and proceed to the next step with the "Next" button.

6. **Final Step:** The progress steps will continue until the final step, where the user will receive confirmation and completion of the project creation process.

## Project Workflow

1. **Step 1:** Users will start at Step 1 with a "Next" button and a prompt for the first step.

2. **Step 2 and Beyond:** For each subsequent step, the "Next" button will guide users through the process. When they reach the final step, the "Next" button will be replaced with a completion message.

3. **Step Navigation:** Users can go back to previous steps using the "Prev" button and continue to the next step with the "Next" button.

## Goal

The goal of this project is to create an interactive and user-friendly progress step component in React that helps users easily navigate and complete the process of creating a new project, using only HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

Let's get started and build this React Progress Step project!
