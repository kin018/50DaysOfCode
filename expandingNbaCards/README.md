# NBA Card Animation Project

This project was built using a combination of CSS, HTML, and JavaScript. Its primary purpose is to create an interactive and engaging user interface that allows an expanding animation when a card representing an NBA player or team is clicked. When active, the card displays information about the NBA team player and their team name. Conversely, if the card is not active, it is minimized to its original state.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML:** The foundation of the project's structure and content is built using HTML, allowing the creation of the card elements and their layout.

- **CSS:** Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) have been used to style the HTML elements, ensuring a visually appealing and user-friendly design. This includes defining the animations for card expansion and minimization.

- **JavaScript (JS):** JavaScript is responsible for adding interactivity to the project. It handles the click event that triggers the expansion and minimization animations, making the project dynamic and user-responsive.

## Functionality

When a user interacts with the card, the following happens:

- **Click Event:** When the user clicks on the NBA card, the JavaScript code is triggered to expand the card, revealing additional information.

- **Active State:** In the active state, the card displays information about the NBA team player, such as their name, stats, or any other relevant details, along with the team name.

- **Minimized State:** If the card is clicked again or if the user clicks outside the card, it returns to its minimized state, hiding the detailed information.

The project's design and functionality provide an engaging way to showcase NBA players and their respective teams while maintaining an intuitive user experience.
